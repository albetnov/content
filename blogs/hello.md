# Welcome To My Blog!
:cover-image{src="/blogs/eenrhihmqjzseefvxfph.jpg" alt="Picture by Tim Mossholder"}

So, welcome to my blog. I honestly have no idea what to write here but hey, I am trying to write a blog here.

So my name is Albet Novendo. I am actually a Backend Developer but I do spent bit of time in Frontend stuff as well (does that makes me a fullstack?). Well, let's move aside. As a Backend Developer my major stack is
PHP, Go, and JS (oh and mysql).

## What can you expect from My Blog?

I will use the blog as the way to document my self, it can either be an experience, tips, code, slice of life, anything.

The blog will be written in between of two language, English and Indonesian (my native).
### Why two?

Nothing specific, I just want to improve my writing ability and grammar so you can expect that I might made some mistake, and hopefully you can help me correct it. The blog is editable with the button of ``Edit On Github``.

Simply, open a pull request, or if you're not sure then you can go ahead and open a discussion first.

So if you found a typo, or incorrect grammar, feel free to open a PR.

### Could it be more?

Well currently, I am learning Chinese Simplified. But I am not quite confident about it, nah not confident it's just I can't write anything yet.

I do have a limited knowledge on hearing and reading. But it's really limited right now. So in the future hopefully, let's mark this blog as the start.


> So again, welcome to my blog. I hope you enjoy reading this. See ya.
